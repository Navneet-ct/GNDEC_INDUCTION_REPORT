INDUCTION REPORT 2025
AUTHOR- NAVNEET KAUR
Recently, I attended the induction program at my college. Since I couldn’t join in the initial days, I missed the beginning where they organized a Kirtan ceremony to seek the blessings of God for both students and teachers, marking the start of the program and the upcoming four years.

I’m not entirely sure what happened during those first four days, but from what I heard, they were quite productive and a really good initiative. I was able to join on the fifth day. That day began with a lecture by a doctor on human values, positivity, and the needs of both the human body and mind—explaining how they are interconnected yet different aspects of life. She also spoke about the idea of life itself, highlighting that it cannot be defined in just one line, a page, or even a book—it’s a never-ending topic. Her key message to us was to always remain positive.

After the lecture, we were given detailed information about various scholarships, programs, and college clubs, such as the Causmic Club, NSS, NCC, and sports activities. They also provided us with a stage to showcase our talents and abilities. To make the event even more lively, our seniors performed on stage, including a vibrant performance on a Punjabi song.
